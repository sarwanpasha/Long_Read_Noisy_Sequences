# Assessing the Resilience of Machine Learning Models on SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequences Generated Using Long-read Specific Errors: A Study

Code for Spike2Vec is taken from the following repository
https://github.com/sarwanpasha/Spike2Vec

The code for PSSM2Vec is given in ```PSSM2Vec_vector_generation.ipynb``` notebook

The code for Min2Vec is given in ```Min2Vec_and_tSNE_logic_code.ipynb``` notebook

Our dataset is available on Google Drive
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1adtr8FImIYTqxM20wgInRqIZ8EJY4HVS?usp=sharing

To run the code, you just need to update the dataset path in the notebooks and it will compute the results.

If you want to use the code or dataset, please cite our paper
